Users save their own LLM key, for an approved endpoint (Settings → LLM key). The key is checked against the endpoint (`GET /v1/models`, no redirect), then sealed with AES-256-GCM under a key-encryption key from the Secret `macaron-llm-kek` (`LLM_KEK_DIR`, files `v1`, `v2`…), bound to its user and endpoint. It's write-only: only its last 4 characters are ever shown. Saving or deleting needs a sign-in younger than 10 minutes and is limited to 5 attempts an hour; each change is in the key's append-only history. `node dist/rotate-llm-keys.js` re-seals every key under the newest key-encryption key.
